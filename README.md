# Weather-Forecast-
Using Classification &amp; Clustering Algorithm to forecast weather based on Seattle weather data. A course final project of STATS 504. This study is an end to end data analysis project. The main idea of this study is to use the history weather data to forecast whether it is going to rain tomorrow.  
We start with raw data and feature engineering, constructed forecasting model based on algorithms we learnt, like SVM, Random Forest and KNN. We used cross-validation to check the accuracy of forecast. Since we have hundreds of weather station's report data, we also tried clustering method to find the distribution of temperature across Seattle and defined a criteria to decided how heavy the rain was.

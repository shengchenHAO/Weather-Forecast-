								<p><span>Title: Research on Early Life and Aging Trends and Effects (RELATE): A Cross-National Study</span></p>
								<p><span>Principal Investigator(s): Mary McEniry, University of Michigan. Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</span></p>
								<p><span>Summary: <p>The Research on Early Life and Aging Trends and Effects (RELATE) study compiles cross-national data that contain information that can be used to examine the effects of early life conditions on older adult health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, obesity, functionality, mortality, and self-reported health.  The complete cross sectional/longitudinal dataset (n=147,278) was compiled from major studies of older adults or households across the world that in most instances are representative of the older adult population either nationally, in major urban centers, or in provinces. It includes over 180 variables with information on demographic and geographic variables along with information about early life conditions and life course events for older adults in low, middle and high income countries. Selected variables were harmonized to facilitate cross national comparisons.</p>
<p>In this first public release of the RELATE data, a subset of the data (n=88,273) is being released.  The subset includes harmonized data of older adults from the following regions of the world: Africa (Ghana and South Africa), Asia (China, India), Latin America (Costa Rica, major cities in Latin America), and the United States (Puerto Rico, Wisconsin). This first release of the data collection is composed of 19 downloadable parts: Part 1 includes the harmonized cross-national RELATE dataset, which harmonizes data from parts 2 through 19. Specifically, parts 2 through 19 include data from Costa Rica (Part 2), Puerto Rico (Part 3), the United States (Wisconsin) (Part 4), Argentina (Part 5), Barbados (Part 6), Brazil (Part 7), Chile (Part 8), Cuba (Part 9), Mexico (Parts 10 and 15), Uruguay (Part 11), China (Parts 12, 18, and 19), Ghana (Part 13), India (Part 14), Russia (Part 16), and South Africa (Part 17). </p>
<p>The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) was also used in the compilation of the larger RELATE data set (HRS) (N=12,527), and these data are now available for public release on the <a href= "http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=data"> HRS data products page</a>. To access the HRS data that are part of the RELATE data set, please see the collection notes below.</p></span></p>

								<p><span>Date of Collection: 1996 -- 2008</span></p>
								<p><span>Data Collection Notes: <p>Data that are part of the complete Research on Early Life and Aging Trends and Effects (RELATE) data but are not yet available for download include data from the Matlab [Bangladesh] Health and Socio-Economic Survey (MHSS), Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), and Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study in Taiwan (SEBAS). As a result, data from these surveys have been omitted from the harmonized cross-national RELATE data (Part 1) as well as country specific data files. However, data from Bangladesh (MHSS) is available as <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/2705">ICPSR 2705</a> and the Taiwan (SEBAS) survey is available as <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/3792">ICPSR 3792.</a> </p>, <p>The funding information included in the "Funding" section of this study description relates exclusively to Dr. McEniry's project to create the RELATE dataset from existing data sources. In addition, the following individuals and Principal Investigators deserve recognition for being instrumental in the release of the first public version of RELATE:  Drs. George Alter, Barry Popkin, David Weir, Yi Zeng, Luis Rosero-Bixby, Ana Luisa DÃ¡vila, Alberto Palloni, Somnath Chatterji, Paul Kowal, Pamela Herd, and Bob Hauser. Finally, it is important to highlight the main funding sources for each of the country specific studies that were used to create the RELATE data. The technical report that accompanies the RELATE data provides the links to the studies where this information can be obtained. In addition, there is a listing of funding sources in the appendices for those datasets that make up the first public release of the RELATE data. For more information on citing the technical report, please see collection note #4 below.</p>, <p>Instructions to access the HRS data that form part of the RELATE data set: Go to the <a href= "http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=data">HRS data products page</a>.

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span>Study Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compile and harmonize cross-national data from both the developing and developed world to allow for the examination of how early life conditions are related to older adult health and well being.</span></p>
								<p><span>Study Design: <p>The selection of countries for this study was based on their diversity but also on the availability of comprehensive cross sectional/panel survey data for older adults born in the early to mid 20th century in low, middle and high income countries. These data were then utilized to create the harmonized cross-national RELATE data (Part 1).</p>
<p>Specifically, data that are being released in this version of the RELATE study come from the following studies:</p>
<p>CHNS (China Health and Nutrition Study)</p>
<p>CLHLS (Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey)</p>
<p>CRELES (Costa Rican Study of Longevity and Healthy Aging)</p>
<p>PREHCO (Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions)</p>
<p>SABE (Study of Aging Survey on Health and Well Being of Elders)</p>
<p>SAGE (WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health)</p>
<p>WLS (Wisconsin Longitudinal Study)</p>
<p>Note that the countries selected represent a diverse range in national income levels: Barbados and the United States (including Puerto Rico) represent high income countries; Argentina, Cuba, Uruguay, Chile, Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia represent upper middle income countries; China and India represent lower middle income countries; and Ghana represents a low income country.</p>
<p>Users should refer to the technical report that accompanies the RELATE data for more detailed information regarding the study design of the surveys used in the construction of the cross-national data.</p></span></p>
								<p><span>Sample: <p>Most studies included in the RELATE data are representative of the older adult population either nationally, in major urban centers or in major provinces. Some studies are representative samples of households from which older adults were selected. In almost all cases studies obtained very respectable response rates.</p>

								<p><span>Original Release Date: 2013-06-12</span></p>
								<p><span>Version Date: 2015-05-07</span></p>
								<p><span>Version History: <p>2013-06-12 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Performed consistency checks.</li><li>Created variable labels and/or value labels.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul>, 2015-05-07 Two variables were dropped from the Harmonized Cross-national RELATE Data file (part 1).  References to these variables in the documentation were removed and a collection note was added.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Analysis Information:</h2>
								<p><span>Weight: Sample weights are applicable to all countries except the United States (Wisconsin) Data and the China (CHNS) Data. Most country-specific surveys had a single sample weight variable. These surveys included: China (CLHLS), Costa Rica,  Puerto Rico, SABE, and SAGE.</span></p>

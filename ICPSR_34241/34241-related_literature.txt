Low and middle income countries experienced rapid demographic changes and
increased life
expectancy during the 1930s-1960s, mainly because of public health
interventions and medical
innovations. Increasingly larger groups of survivors of poor early life
conditions continued to
live in poor socioeconomic conditions which continued to produce a stunted
population. Older
adults from these cohorts may now exhibit sharper SES health inequalities
due to being less
socially mobile as a result of early life conditions. Drawing from a subset
of the harmonized
cross national RELATE data (n=160,661), we examined the degree to which
this conjecture has
merit by comparing SES health disparities according to adult height for
measured obesity, selfreported
diabetes, and measured hypertension in older adults from low and middle
income
countries born in the 1930s through the mid-1940s and living in urban
areas. We benchmarked
results using data from the US and England. A positive education gradient
appeared for obesity
in taller individuals but there was no significant gradient for shorter
individuals; sharper
positive gradients appeared for diabetes for shorter individuals; and no
significant association
appeared for hypertension for individuals of any height. In contrast, the
US and England
showed significant negative gradients for education across all health
outcomes. The results show
the overall importance of early life conditions in adult health,
particularly for obesity, across all
developing countries, in contrast with US and England. However, the results
do not produce
convincing evidence of the conjecture regarding sharper SES inequalities in
the cohorts born
during the 1930s-1940s. Nevertheless, because obesity is a strong predictor
of diabetes and
hypertension, the results may forecast what is to come for the health of
cohorts born in the later
period of the 1930s-1960s.

\subsection{Dataset in Use}

The dataset used in our study is obtained from \href{https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/}{NOAA} (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). It is a part of NOAA's GHCN(Global Historical Climatology Network)-Daily database\cite{noaa}, and is concerned with daily climate data of Seattle from January \engordnumber{1}, 2012 to January \engordnumber{1}, 2018. The records are colloected from up to 190 stations accross Seattle area, with different sets of attributes. The main attributes are listed in Table \ref{tbld}.

For practical use, we sample $70\%$ of the data as the training set, and the rest as the test set.

The models are also applied to daily climate data of New York in 2017, which come from the same database.
